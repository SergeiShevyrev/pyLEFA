#PyLEFA (Lineament Extraction Fracture Analysis) v. 0.6a
Analytical GUI remote sensing software for lineament detection and fracture analysis

##1.About pyLEFA Software 
pyLEFA software is originally written in Python GUI application for satellite image (tested with Landsat and SRTM) analysis in Earth sciences. Lineament analysis is often being used for geological mapping, detecting natural hazards and prospecting of mineral resources. 
pyLEFA allows to:
-Extract lineament features on satellite image (Landsat 7 and 8, SRTM and some others are supported);
-Compute feature spatial distribution parameters (lineament density);
-Compute Minkowski dimension of lineaments;
-Detect fault by joining of lineaments;
-Export features into ESRI shape format to continue work in GIS software.
Author put his emphasis to the simplicity and absence of non-free software in pyLEFA. In contrast with now deprecated LEFA (Matlab based), PyLEFA doesn’t need any preinstalled software. 


##2.About the author
The Author, Dr. Sergei L. Shevyrev is researcher and associate professor. Research and teaching interests include regional geology, geotectonics and geodynamics, remote sensing, modeling and computer programming. 

##3.System Requirements and Third party tools
Hardware:
PC with 3000 MB RAM
Software:
PyLEFA was tested with the Microsoft Windows (tm) 10 and expected to be compatible with the newer versions. 32 bit versions of Windows aren't supported. 
Data sources:
Program could be used for analysis of Landsat and SRTM data affordable from the relevant repositories. Compatibility with the other data sources wasn’t analyzed. QuantumGIS (QGIS) software is recommended for geotiff  and shape output stacking and projecting.
