This folder is for testing Python scripts that could (or couldn't) be implemented in future versions 
of pyLEFA.

<b>2024.05.30</b> Added main.py and ca_plot.py 
main.py script are for opening datatable (CSV format) saved from pyLEFA 0.61a and 
performing basis analyses over it (Pearson criteria). K-means analysis is performed over the standartized table data.
ca_plot.py is capable to complute fractal C-A plot for datatable fields [Yousefi, Carranza, 2015]. This method is used for proper establishing of class boundaries.
